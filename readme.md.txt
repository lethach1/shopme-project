Here's a sample `README.md` file for your project, with instructions on how to set it up and run it using Docker:

---

# Shopme Project

This project contains the **Shopme Frontend** and **Shopme Backend** services, which are dockerized and configured to run with MySQL as the database. The frontend is accessible on port 80, and the backend is accessible on port 8080.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** should be installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopme-project.git
   cd shopme-project
   

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Ensure you have the following environment variables set in your Docker Compose file, particularly for AWS S3 configuration if required for file storage.

3. **Build and Start the Containers**

   Run the following command to build and start all services (MySQL, backend, and frontend):

   docker-compose up -d

   - This command will:
     - Start MySQL on port 3307 (mapped to 3306 inside the container).
     - Start the Shopme backend on port 8080.
     - Start the Shopme frontend on port 80.

4. **Check Container Status**

   To verify if the containers are running, use:

   docker ps

5. **Access the Application**

   - Shopme Frontend**: http://localhost
   - Shopme Backend**: http://localhost:8080/ShopmeAdmin

## Additional Commands

- **Stopping Containers**

  To stop the containers without removing them:

 
  docker-compose stop

- **Rebuilding Containers**

  If you've made changes to the code and want to rebuild the images:

  docker-compose up --build -d

- **Removing Containers**

  To stop and remove the containers:

  docker-compose down

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the ports (80 and 8080) are not occupied by other services.
- Confirm that Docker Compose has access to create the necessary volumes for MySQL data persistence.
